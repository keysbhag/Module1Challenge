# Horiseon Main Page Refactor

## Description

The motivation for this project was to refactor a pre-existing webpage's HTML and CSS format so that it is more accessible for people with disabilities, who need assistive devices such as screen readers to get information from a page. We also wanted to optimize SEO for the webpage so that it can be found more easily.
With the refactoring of the HTML code, we achieve the goals above but, by also consolidating the CSS and adding comments, we help any future developers who view this webpage's code and, want make changes or add more features. Through this process, I've learned that you should be mindful of how you structure and label your code as you develop it and make sure that there is a way that it can be accessible to everyone.
